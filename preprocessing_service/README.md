Here's the complete guide to available datasets in Google Earth Engine (GEE), including temporal and spatial resolution:

# Main Datasets for Global and Argentina Images

## 1. Landsat
### Characteristics and Temporal Resolution:
- **Landsat 9** (2021-present)
  - Spatial resolution: 30m
  - Temporal resolution: 16 days
  - ID: `LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2`

- **Landsat 8** (2013-present)
  - Spatial resolution: 30m
  - Temporal resolution: 16 days
  - ID: `LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2`

- **Landsat 7** (1999-2023)
  - Spatial resolution: 30m
  - Temporal resolution: 16 days
  - Note: Has scan line issues since 2003
  - ID: `LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2`

- **Landsat 5** (1984-2012)
  - Spatial resolution: 30m
  - Temporal resolution: 16 days
  - ID: `LANDSAT/LT05/C02/T1_L2`

## 2. Sentinel
### Characteristics and Temporal Resolution:
- **Sentinel-2** (2015-present)
  - Spatial resolution: 10m, 20m, 60m (depending on band)
  - Temporal resolution: 5 days (combining Sentinel-2A and 2B)
  - Ideal for agricultural and forest monitoring
  - ID: `COPERNICUS/S2_SR`

- **Sentinel-1 SAR**
  - Spatial resolution: 10m (Ground Range Detected)
  - Temporal resolution: 6-12 days
  - Useful for areas with high cloud coverage
  - ID: `COPERNICUS/S1_GRD`

## 3. MODIS
### Characteristics and Temporal Resolution:
- Spatial resolution: 250m-1km
- Temporal resolution: Daily
- Available products:
  - Daily Surface Reflectance: `MODIS/006/MOD09GA`
  - Vegetation Indices 16-Day: `MODIS/006/MOD13Q1`

## Recommendations by Region in Argentina

### Pampas Region (Agriculture):
- Sentinel-2 for 10m resolution and 5-day frequency
- Landsat 8/9 as complement (30m, 16 days)

### Northern Region (Forest Areas):
- Combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat
- Sentinel-1 for periods of high cloud coverage

### Patagonia (Arid Zones):
- Sentinel-1 for cloud penetration capability
- Landsat for multitemporal analysis
